Sydney Activities
Bike Hire at The Rocks, ride through Barangaroo and Darling Harbour to Pyrmont Fish Market.
Ride back, and over the Harbour Bridge, stopping for a swim at North Sydney Pool.

Coastal walk from Bondi to Coogee beach.

Ferry to Manly, and take a hike up to North Head for scenic views of the harbour.


Opera House Tour.

Local Food
I like to grab a quick lunch Cafe Boardroom, just up the road from CISRA.
