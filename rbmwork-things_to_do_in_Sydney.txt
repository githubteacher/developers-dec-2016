1. Take ferry from Circular Quay to Manly

2. Buy lunch and eat somewhere on harbour foreshore or overlooking ocean beach.

3. Walk from Mrs Macquarie's Chair past SOH and on to the Rocks.

4. Two nights ... tricky. Catch train from Macquarie Park station to Milsons Point. Walk across Harbour Bridge to city.
