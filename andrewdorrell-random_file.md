# Sydney visit

## Katoomba in the Blue Mountains
### Things to do
- Scenic world is a must https://www.scenicworld.com.au/. If you are up for a walk and some nice scenery on the way, you can walk down and catch the scenic railway up

### Places to eat
- many great little places up and down the main street

### Bars and hangouts
- The Carrington (www.thecarrington.com.au/) is a wonderful old hotel that you can stay at or just go hang out at the bar or lounge

----------------

## Sydney city
### Things to do:
- a well rounded day in the city would involve a trip to the botanic gardens, curcular quay, take a ferry across to manly and maybe go parasailing (www.discovermanly.com.au/parasailing.html) or just get a nogen vaas and walk the beachfront. Finish with a dinner at a restaurant along the walk between the opera house and the quay.

### Places to stay
- No idea sorry - I always stay at my place ;-)
